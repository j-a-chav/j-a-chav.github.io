# My Favorite CPSC120L Labs

Lab 4

For this lab, we wrote two programs that: 1) converted various US units to other units given conversion ratios and; 2) created a 2-player number guessing game. What I liked about part 1 was thinking how to form the conversion functions. For part 2, I liked the simplicity of using if / if-else statements and user inputs to generate winning outputs and error outputs that proved to be satisfying upon playing it.


Lab 6

For lab 6, we wrote two programs that: 1) created sandwich ingredients using command line arguments and; 2) calculated the score for a hand of blackjack using command line arguments. For both parts, I appreciated how to use command line arguments including how to use the “.size” member functions and if statements to get the exact index size you need.


Lab 12

The 12th lab had us creating two similar programs using GraphicsMagick that: 1) created an animation of an amalgamation composed of red, blue, and green gradient channel gifs and; 2)  worked with pseudorandom generators, images, conditions, functions, and loops to create an image with large inputted text in the foreground and animated static in the background. My favorite was part 1 because it was the first time I had programmed an implementation of an animation and found it especially satisfying by the final result.
